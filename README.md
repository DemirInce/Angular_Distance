# Angular_Distance

Measures the angular distance between any two points on a 360-degree by 180-degree image from a 360 camera. By default, the dimensions are 6080 by 3040 (the resolution of the camera I own).  

Click on two points to measure the distance.

C to clear all measurements.

Note: The distortions are a result of the equirectangular projection onto a flat surface. During calculation the image is projected to the inside of a sphere and the segment of the great circle in between the two points is measured. The straight lines draw are simply for reference, the number displayed is the true measurement.
